## Overview

I created a basic weather api program in Java. It asks the user for a city name, and takes that name and creates a weather alert report file. It also allows the user to read other txt alert files already created. 

My purpose was to learn to create a basic program with classes in Java, and learn how to make HTTP requests in Java. Java is one of the most popular, and well-respected languages out there, so I wanted to become more familiar with it.

## Development Environment

I created this Java project in Eclipse. 

I used java.util.Scanner, java.io.FileWriter/Reader, java.io.BuffWriter/Reader, java.io.File, java.io.IOException, java.io.InputStreamReader, java.net.URL, and java.net.HttURLConnection libraries.

## Future Work

- Create menu for user to choose from (create/write/read/delete)
- Convert to Maven project to allow for more modern Java flexibility
- Make text output more user-friendly
- Update requests using newer Java REST libraries like GSON/Jackson
